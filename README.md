Coronary Heart Disease Risk Prediction: A Comparative Study of Multiple Classifiers

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating effective risk assessment tools for early detection and prevention. This project aims to predict the ten-year risk of developing CHD using machine learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset containing various health indicators, including demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors, we implement multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to identify significant predictors of CHD risk. Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, we evaluate model performance based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning models to enhance predictive accuracy and facilitate informed clinical decision-making. This work underscores the importance of integrating advanced analytical techniques in public health initiatives to improve cardiovascular health outcomes.
